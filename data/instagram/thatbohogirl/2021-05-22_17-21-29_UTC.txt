My dry shampoo routine ✨
•I try to wash my hair my only once or max twice a week. 

•Washing your hair too often will strip the hair of its natural oils and can dull hair colour. 

•One of the best ways to restore shine to your hair is by washing less frequently, which helps prevent dryness and preserve luster.

•I use Batiste Dry Shampoo, works best for my hair.
