My parents always taught me the value of financial independence. We were always taught that hard work can beat anything, and if you start today youâ€™ll thank your future self in 5 years. As I grow older, I realise how important it is to work on your goals & become a better version of yourself along the way. 
When I wake up, I THANK GOD that I get to call this a job & Iâ€™m never going to take that for granted. I promised myself in 2017 that Iâ€™m going to branch out, and challenge myself even more. 
4 years later, 
Iâ€™ve started a podcast with my sister 
Grew my Instagram from 450k to 1.2 Million (crazy to even say it out loud) 
Grew my YouTube channel from 50k to almost 500k 
Started @unkutkritika & connected with so many people on a deeper level.
Travelled to almost 22 countries in total. 
Spoke at a panel (my biggest fear)
