âœ¨22.8.2014âœ¨ 7 years ago this day I started my blogging journey. Never in a million years I wouldâ€™ve thought about making a career out of it & having a million people believing in meðŸ˜­ (swipe to see the last picture ðŸ¤£)

When I look back, with all the ups & downs I would still go down the same path. Yes, Iâ€™ve had my doubts in between but thatâ€™s the beauty of it. 
I feel like Iâ€™ve literally grown up with you guys & I wouldnâ€™t have asked for a better community who shower me with so much love everyday. 
Your messages, dms and comments means the world & I can assure you, Iâ€™ll never take any of this for granted. 
Thank you thank you ðŸ’›
I started with 0 knowledge about this digital world and along the way learned everything on my own & YouTube helped ðŸ˜‚. I was wearing 10 different hats and at the same time acted as a producer, editor, manager, artist, financing, marketing & a lot more. 
If I can encourage someone out there today with my journey, then that would be enough for me.
Yes, nothing is guaranteed but thatâ€™s what makes it exciting. 
If youâ€™ve been waiting to start that one project, that one idea that you think will be crazy good, a blog or a YouTube channelâ€¦PLEASE START TODAY. 

Start posting and sharing if this is something that think you would enjoy because you donâ€™t know where you are going to be 7 years down the line.
