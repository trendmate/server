My top 4 Nude/Brown lipsticks ðŸ’„

Sharing with you my Top 4 Brown/Nude liquid lipsticks ðŸ’„ðŸ¤Ž

1. @maybelline.india superstay matte ink in Fighter, super long lasting, perfect for long days!
2. @mynykaa lip crayon in Mocha Sin, nudish brown, perfect for everyday wear
3. @nyxcosmetics_in liquid suede in 07, itâ€™s more of a pale nude, I love to top up my darker lipsticks with this to tone them down, can be worn on their own too, but might wash some complexions out
4. @lorealparis ultra matte liquid lipstick in volupto choco, creamy matte texture, love the taste and smell of thisðŸ¤¤a light nude with terracotta undertonesâœ¨
