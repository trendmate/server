Skipping sunscreen harms your skin in so many ways. 
It can cause premature ageing as well. Itâ€™s important that you use sunscreen even while sitting at home. Here are my top 5 sunscreensðŸŒž 
1. Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunblock SPF 50+ 
Doesnâ€™t clog the pores and itâ€™s lightweight 
2. La Shield Sunscreen Gel SPF 40 P++
Oil-free & non greasy formula 
3. Reequil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA ++++ 
Recently started using it. Super smooth & I sometimes use it like a primer 
4. Lotus Herbals Safe Sun Uv Screen Matte Gel Pa+++ SPF - 50 (Momâ€™s fave)
5. Cetaphil Sun SPF 30 Light Gel- been using it for over 2 months now and is still my fave
