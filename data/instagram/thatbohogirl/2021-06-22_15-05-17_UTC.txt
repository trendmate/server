Since last year, I’ve been taking care about my health, and my version of being fit is a lil realistic!
One of my fitness essentials is a pair of comfortable shoes.. 👟😍doesn’t matter if I’m walking, running, or any other kind of physical activity to stay fit, these @reebokindia walking  shoes are a constant! ✨

Love how lightweight and comfortable they are, as soon as I step into them, I feel so pepped up about my daily walk!🏃🏻‍♀️

Also, love the minimalist, plain white design that goes with all my active wear! Check out their walking range for many more options! 

Don’t compromise on your feet, that’s the last thing you wanna take for granted! 😌🥰
