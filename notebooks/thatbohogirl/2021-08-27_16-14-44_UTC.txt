One fact about me, I can’t do without music! Music is like therapy to me.. Be it while getting ready, taking a walk, chilling alone, I have to have my music playing! It’s a part of my day that I look forward to..😍
If that’s the case with you too, tune into ‘The Happy Concert’ on 28th August, 6 PM, sponsored by @BPL.INDIA and watching @officialluckyali perform your favorite songs! 🥺🔥 #BPL #BPLIndia #TheHappyConcert
