A sneak peek into my  #Indiagenous trip to Lucknow, have you been yet? ✨
Was there for 3 days with @agoda, had so much fun that I wish I could have extended the trip... the highlights for me were the beautiful monuments we visited, the street food oh my god, and the beautiful chikankari collections😍🤤
