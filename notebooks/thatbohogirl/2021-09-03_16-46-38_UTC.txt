Our very first magazine cover together. @socialketchup Couldn‚Äôt be happier to do this with none other than my sister @deekshakhurana 

Growing up I remember looking at models & celebrities on various covers. What would it feel like?
Powerful
Proud 
Ecstatic 
Empowering 

And few years later‚Ä¶here we‚Äôre! 
So proud of how far we‚Äôve come ü•≤ 

More than anything we feel blessed and we are grateful to all of you! It‚Äôs because of you guys, we have made it so far ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Also, thank you @socialketchup for this.Many more milestones to come!

Go download the copy & read about our journey, our special moments together and how we learnt everything!
