It’s all fun and games until you’ve to rethink every reply, recheck if the gas is off (10 times), practising what you’re gonna say at your family gathering next week, when you avoid calling people because you can’t do calls, and the best part when anyone says ‘oh she’s just shy’ ‘you’ll get over it’
