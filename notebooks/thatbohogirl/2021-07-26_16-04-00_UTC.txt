Dull skin? Your skin is probably lacking some Vitamin C! 🍊 Here’s what I do to combat dullness. 

Vitamin C and Vitamin Sea, both are crucial for me! While the latter isn’t as easily accessible, at least one of them is! 

I’ve been trying out this Lakme 9 to 5 Vit C+ range, and the dullness in my skin has radically reduced. I use the Serum before makeup as it gives a great base and treats the skin as well. Fun fact - it has 100% real Kakadu plum extract which has 100 times more Vitamin C than 🍊! Follow this up with the Day Cream which has Shea Butter and Vitamin C & E. My PM routine is super simple as well with the serum and the night cream that has Shea Butter, Murumuru Butter & Glycerine - love using it at night! 

Vitamin C is one ingredient you need to dramatically brighten your skin, so if your skin is demanding some attention, definitely check it out!
