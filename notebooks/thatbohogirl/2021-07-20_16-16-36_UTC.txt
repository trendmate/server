Myth Busting 101 ğŸ’¯
Makeup doesnâ€™t cause acne in most cases, if you experience breakouts after makeup, thatâ€™s because youâ€™re probably not taking it off right! ğŸ¤­ Also, never wear makeup to bed, no matter how tired you are!ğŸ˜…
Taking it off is simple, doesnâ€™t have to be a 1000 steps, I use a micellar water, cleanser, and then moisturiser! These products from @simpleskincareindia are dermatologically tested and non comedogenicâœ¨you can shop these on @mynykaa ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦
