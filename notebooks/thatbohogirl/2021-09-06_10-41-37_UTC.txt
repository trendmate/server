Who is she? 😅
I was 10 or 11 & the only memory I’ve is getting nervous about school tomorrow. 
Will I be able to score above 90%, what I will do when I grow up, how to skip my turn in class (reciting, reading or actively participating).
To be honest, i still get nightmares about all this.😂
Phew! Only if I could go and tell her-
You’re going to figure everything out, you will receive loads of love from a lot of people and most importantly ,you’re going to make your parents proud ♥️
