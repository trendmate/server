5 products I’m loving this month 😍🤍

@theearthrhythm cleansing jelly
It melts off my makeup like magic!✨but don’t forget to double cleanse with a face wash!

@mynykaa prep me up primer
Provides a perfect smooth base for makeup 😍

@cetaphil_india Sun SPF 50 Light Gel
Sunscreen is a must whether you’re stepping out or not! Don’t skip it, ever!

@thebodyshopindia Lip&Cheek tint
Love how light and natural this looks, I use it almost all the time, who wants a separate video on this? Lemme know ✨

@lagirlindia orange corrector
If you’ve dark circles, this is your saviour for avoiding that ashy grey cast when you apply concealer. Use it under the concealer to correct the darkness for an even base✨

These were my favourites, lemme know yours in the comments below😘
